# gz-cipher

`gz-cipher` is a command line tool providing common ciphers to gzip and encrypt large files(or gunzip and decrypt) with low memory cost using Node built-in `stream`, `zlib` and `crypto` modules.

It is based on a practice when I was trying to implement a Transform `stream` and found it could be a handy tool to encrypt/decrypt large files.
